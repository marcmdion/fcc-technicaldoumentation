            <p>Health truly is wealth.
            Your job might be able to replace you within 1 week if you drop dead hehe
            The joints you damage today will get their revenge later. Even if you think they’ve recovered completely.</p>
            <p>Body acceptance improves self-esteem, body image satisfaction, and physical and psychological well-being.</p>

            <p>Living in the same place as the people you love matters. I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else.
            
            <p>Priorities matter. Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia.</p>
            </p>

            <p>Quality time matters. If you’re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you’re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious.</p>

            <p>Quit and you might as well be dead. If you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there; you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level</p>
            <p>Deliberate practice is different. It entails considerable, specific, and sustained efforts to do something you can’t do well—or even at all.</p>

            <p>Try to internalize the fact that everything you do is a choice.
            Start by thinking about the terms we’ve used in these posts, and if they resonated with you, write them down. Part of the reason I assigned terms to so many of these feelings or phenomena—the Instant Gratification Monkey, the Rational Decision-Maker, the Panic Monster, the Dark Playground, Ickiness, Bricks, the Critical Entrance, the Dark Woods, the Tipping Point, the Happy Playground, Flow, your Storyline—is that terms help you clarify the reality of the choices you’re making. It helps expose bad choices and highlights when it’s most critical to make good ones</p>
                  <p>Some possible methods:

            Solicit external support by telling one or more friends or family members about a goal you’re trying to accomplish and asking them to hold you to it. If that’s hard for whatever reason, email it to me—I’m a stranger (contact@waitbutwhy.com)—and just typing out a goal and sending it to a real person can help make it more real. (Some experts argue that telling people in your life about a goal can be counterproductive, so this depends on your particular situation.) Create a Panic Monster if there’s not already one in place—if you’re trying to finish an album, schedule a performance for a few months from now, book a space, and send out an invitation to a group of people.
            If you really want to start a business, quitting your job makes the Panic Monster your new roommate. If you’re trying to write a consistent blog, put “new post every Tuesday” at the top of the page…
            Leave post-it notes for yourself, reminding you to make good choices. Set an alarm to remind yourself to start a task, or to remind you of the stakes.
            Minimize distractions by all means necessary. If TV’s a huge problem, sell your TV. If the internet’s a huge problem, get a second computer for work that has Wifi disabled, and turn your phone on Airplane Mode during work sessions. Lock yourself into something—put down a non-refundable deposit for lessons or a membership.</p>
            <p>Aim for slow, steady progress—Storylines are rewritten one page at a time.
            In the same way a great achievement happens unglorious brick by unglorious brick, a deeply-engrained habit like procrastination doesn’t change all at once, it changes one modest improvement at a time. Remember, this is all about showing yourself you can do it, so the key isn’t to be perfect, but to simply improve. The author who writes one page a day has written a book after a year. The procrastinator who gets slightly better every week is a totally changed person a year later.

            Because defeating procrastination is the same thing as gaining control over your own life. So much of what makes people happy or unhappy—their level of fulfillment and satisfaction, their self-esteem, the regrets they carry with them, the amount of free time they have to dedicate to their relationships—is severely affected by procrastination. So it’s worthy of being taken dead seriously, and the time to start improving is now.</p>

          <p>We’re bad at predicting what will make us most happy, and we don’t even realise how bad we are.
          The fact that we often judge the pleasure of an experience by its ending can cause us to make some curious choices.</p>
          <p>These lines are completely flat by $75,000, so beyond this point, income had no relationship with how happy, sad or stressed people felt. This is hardly surprising – we all know people who’ve gone into high earning jobs and ended up miserable./p>

            <p>It has become an accepted part of our culture to believe that -We are all destined to do something extraordinary. If everyone extraordinary then by definition, no one is extraordinary. Being average has become the new standard of failure.</p>
            <p>Accepting the bland and mundane truths of life. The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy and that's okay. This vegetable course will taste bad at first(very bad, you will avoid accepting it) but your body will wake up feeling more potent and alive.</p>
            <p>"Quit and you might as well be dead. If you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there; you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you.

            <p>Because the funny thing about money is you always feel like you need more – even when you have enough, you never have enough After a few years in the workforce many people will start to figure out their number. If I could only make $X a year I would be set. The problem is that once you reach that level there will always be another one and then another after that you’ll be striving for. It’s obviously not a bad thing to make more money, but making more money alone isn’t going to make you happy.</p>
            <p>Money can make you happy. Spending can change your happiness. It’s how you spend it.• Investing in experiences.• Buying time for yourself.• investing in others. Giving away.( It makes you happier and healthier. )</p>
